# FlightRank-2025-Aeroclub-RecSys-Cup
Code for 2nd place solution of FlightRank 2025: Aeroclub RecSys Cup

To reproduce the 2nd place solution:

1. Run each of the notebooks (NB0034 to NB0050) step by step. Make sure to change the data and save paths.
2. Run ensemble_optuna_bucketoptim_final.ipynb
3. The generated file - ensemble_test_predictions_ranked_pd.csv will be saved to disk. (Pvt LB: 0.54175)

NB0036.ipynb will generate a file NB0036/ensemble_test_predictions_ranked.csv which is the best single model submission (Pvt LB:0.53807)
